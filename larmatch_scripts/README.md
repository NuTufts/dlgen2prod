# LArMatch deploy scripts on the grid.

This is for running the larmatch network only. This is for development and analysis of larmatch performance purposes.

If you want to run the LANTERN reconstruction from the dlmerged input files see: `larmatch_and_reco_scripts`.


Notes:

* Tested to work on CPU nodes and the A100 nodes (so fast!).
* Should be able to launch jobs using submit scripts.
* When processing official sample. Please store it in the arxiv folder for future reference.
